## FAQ

#### Why is it so simple?

I focused more on the hypermedia project part 2 rather on this one. Also I'm a big fan of simple and clean designs, where less buttons and interactive tools the better. A CV must show all information at once and making it with buttons and sliders just limits the content an average visitor can see, just putting more rocks on the road.

#### Why a stickman?

I bought a new pc and I didn't keep most of my profile pictures from the old pc, so actually I have no images on myself on my own pc. If I had to look up from old historials i'd rather make it simple
